Short Description

== Description ==

Adds a location field to the Add/Edit post form. You can type a full address, or simply just a postcode/zipcode (best to add country also e.g. SW 87B, UK). To display a map, there is a "Post Map" widget, with option to set Zoom level, map width and map height.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to your Wordpress Plugins directory.
2. Activate!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= What is the map does not display correct location? =
Though most of the time, the postcode or zipcode is enough, it is recommended to add the country also.

= Does it only work if a postcode is used? =
You can use any location address format you wish, just be aware that for accuracy, postocode provides the most reliable map location.
